#WP-FOAAS
This WordPress plugin provides access to [F*ck Off As A Service](https://github.com/tomdionysus/foaas) in your post and page content via shortcodes.
#Shortcode Examples
[foaas command=off name=Bob from=Sue] returns: *Fuck off, Bob.- Sue*

[foaas command=shakespeare name=Fallstaff from='Prince Henry'] returns: *Falstaff, Thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson obscene greasy tallow-catch! - Prince Henry*

[foaas command=cool from='not your bro'] returns: *Cool story, Bro - not your bro*

#Motivation
This project started out as a joke when FOAAS was posted by a client of mine, but it became a reality because I needed PHP practice and at least one finished plugin on my resume.

#Installation
Download the zip, then upload it in WordPress via Upload Plugin and activate. A reference for shortcode options will be found under settings. Eventually I will try submitting this plugin to the WordPress Repository.

#Contributors
Just me, but I want to thank the [FOAAS](https://github.com/tomdionysus/foaas) maniacs for everything :) This wouldn't be possible without them.
